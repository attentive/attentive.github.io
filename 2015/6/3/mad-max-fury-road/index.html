Today's films of violent spectacle are dominated by ulterior constraints, with one eye on continuity and the other on replicability. Their big budget set pieces often seem encumbered by mandatory layers of reflective, fracturing, synthetic geometries.</p><p>The lowering of expectations develops a corresponding tension that's highly sensitive to the remembrance of a time before some crisis—Computers? <a href="http://marvel.com/avengers">Franchises</a>? Appeal to international markets? <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2THVvshvq0Q">Michael Bay</a>?—created the current scarcity of authentic action entertainment.</p><p>Through this impoverished landscape wanders a grizzled loner: the "maestro", George Miller. His previous Mad Max films are popular and influential works with lasting cult status, <a href="http://www.ballardian.com/mad-max-punks-sistine-chapel-a-ballardian-primer">lauded by cult figures</a>, growing in the telling, favoured by aficionados and trainspotters. Miller had <a href="http://www.wired.com/2015/05/mad-max-fury-road/">1,465 hand sketched storyboards and 3,454 panels</a> before a needless word was written for the screenplay. He had a purist's intent on live action stunt work and effects, a critically approved cast, and a <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hEJnMQG9ev8">damn fine teaser trailer</a>. He didn’t have any particular responsibility to align with or pave the way for other stories. And a rampaging swarm of critics is consequently ready to devour his new film, Mad Max: Fury Road.</p><p>Fury Road's four colour palette—black, white, metal and dust—is equalled by its sharp material delineation of good and evil. Far from anarchic, its lens captures an extreme, directed and violent order: every human in it is a slave, a prisoner, a slave-driver or a raider, and the film's empty landscape is divided arbitrarily between the territories of the small handful of them able to draw the plot’s attention.</p><p>In the first establishing shot, Max Rockatansky (Tom Hardy) stands alone atop a barren hill, back turned to the viewer, surveying the desert plain below. His figure is filth and dust and matted hair, heavily dressed in boots and leathers. Within a minute he will commit an act of killing, degrade himself to survive, suffer through memories of loss, resolve to continue into the unknown, and be revealed to be under lethal pursuit.</p><p>This economy of exposition continues as Imperator Furiosa (Charlize Theron) is introduced. Furiosa is the tough war leader of the ugly and corrupt Immortan Joe (Hugh Keays-Byrne), ruler of the Citadel, his conditional life supported by a totenkopf breathing mask. The protagonists' traits and relationships are sketched with graceful speed by way of closeups and physicality, and the barely qualified rapacious evil of the villains is matched by their bodily transgressions: war paint, radioactive tumours, mutancy, fetishes, and back shed transhumanism. </p><p>These manoeuvres of character are enacted within the coarser positioning of Fury Road's vehicular choreography, an ingenious series of traditional car chases that substitute for a plot, each brought to an uncanny pitch of vitality by sheer excess, and accompanied by a tongue in cheek diegetic double-necked heavy metal guitar.</p><p>The success of these chases on their own terms is unquestionable and visceral. The editing and camerawork is relatively sedate, intercutting elevations of a world of rigid bodies in motion rhythmically with tracking shots at wheel height, always tracing out a long vector to the horizon. In this inertial frame, cars, trucks and other contraptions collide, scrape, block, crush, explode, and rain blood, oil and fire upon one another, leaving wreck after wreck in a process that wears the large cast down by attrition. The few brief pauses come on as a sudden relief from the transfixion of danger.</p><p>There is no doubt that Fury Road matches up to its hype and addresses some current deficits of action cinema, and it doesn't fail to entertain. Setting aside these virtues, its premise is that of a fallen world. As is often the case, this roughly translates as the fall of the white world into the imagined conditions of the developing world. The almost contemptibly familiar presence of Aussie TV stars such as John Howard and Angus Sampson, both attired like fetish bears from a BDSM club night, is a reminder that the wasteland in view used to be Australia. The rest of the world has become the "Salt", and it’s notable that there is hardly a person of colour in the film; also the allusions to Indigenous cultures of Beyond Thunderdome have disappeared. Whatever form of social regrowth might contrast to the tabula rasa of this landscape is hardly visualised, referred to as the "Green Place". As in The Road Warrior, the art direction of Miller's bone-white diorama of purgatory flirts with Nazi aesthetics via an agreeably dated post-punk gothicism, a Modernist concept of the industrial, and the remnant memory of Australia as penal colony.</p><p>In this environment a story of seized women unfolds, echoing the Iliad or the pursuit of Diarmuid and Gráinne. According to the film's narrative logic, these women's bodies are the locus of forces that will renew the earth. The Green Place itself is understood to belong to them and in some sense, to be their destiny. This idealised fertility is counterposed to and intertwined with an industrial fiction of procedural childbirth and child-rearing, in which batteries of wet nurses pump "mother's milk" into great vats, and Immortan Joe's gang of congenitally defective bastards bicker for paternal attention. Enslaved women are a vital utility in an economy built on the exchange of fluids: milk, water, blood and fuel; but the Five Wives rescued from Joe by Furiosa, the central driver of the plot, are suggested to be the bioweapon that will transform this economy.</p><p>To its credit, Fury Road does manage to contain these potentially disastrous propositions by making the de-objectification and individuation of the Five Wives a major concern. Meanwhile, dramatic agency is apportioned between Furiosa and Max. The flashbacks used to invest Max with a tragic past are clumsy, but the emphasis on the character's fragility allows Tom Hardy's rendition to skirt an otherwise merely impassive masculinity. Although Charlize Theron, extremely convincing as Furiosa, is the rational and sympathetic core of the film, it is Hardy's Max whose soul will be put to the question—a gendered pattern that is repeated among the supporting cast. There is a sharply curtailed view of the possible here, though: when the film does reach its conclusion, the distinction that has been drawn between the good and bad has led to no wide-ranging material effect.</p><p>Bankrolled with the huge budget that he needed, in Fury Road George Miller has hot-rodded the vision of The Road Warrior, augmenting it with spare parts from contemporary sensibility, and impelling it with a ferocious mute velocity that makes for superb entertainment. But Mad Max's world, for all its harping on existential questions, remains not global but provincial. It’s holed up somewhere with thinly stocked bookshelves in the suburbs of Australia in about 1980, never having dreamt of alterity. Of course, this will only endear it to Australians. But though its violence makes it feel almost real, we know our future could never look like this, and what could once have been a cautionary tale is now something diminished: a rather beautiful, idiosyncratic fantasy.</p></body></html></div>
