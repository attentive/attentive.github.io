	  <div class="silkscreen-body"><html><head></head><body><p><em>Spacetime tells matter how to move, and matter tells spacetime how to curve.</em></p><p>The famous distilment of general relativity is a concise metaphor for the mutual flux of ideology and the mass culture produced alongside it. </p><p>Over the next week and a half, <em>The Force Awakens</em> will be released in about eighty countries, and become the first new <em>Star Wars</em> film for a decade. Like the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chicxulub_impactor">Chixculub impact</a> that precipitated the extinction of three quarters of the Earth's species, its arrival will have secondary effects ranging from the banal to the debilitating. </p><p>There will be a hail of critical responses feeding back into the hype, formularising the film's qualities, intensifying the imperative to purchase a ticket to join a dialogue of reactions. Is <em>The Force Awakens</em> profound, good fun, controversial, racist, charming, or wonderfully meticulous? As each vector of concerns pushes against the others, the sum will be: see for yourself and tell us what you thought. Whether you love or hate it, you must watch it. </p><p>Studios benefit at the box office when their films release adjacent to drift-piles of crowdsourced criticism. This bundling of critical text with the product has become nearly as significant to film and television promotion as the conventional review and the marketing blitz. New works routinely nod at the talking points they want their critics to take up and virally propagate. What if it were possible to critique <em>The Force Awakens</em> without having seen it—without having actually paid for a ticket?</p><p>Take as a starting point a familiar interpretation of the original <em>Star Wars</em> as a Cold War fantasy. The Galactic Empire stands for a blurry Soviet "totalitarianism", and the Rebel Alliance for the first world. The nuclear anxiety of the Cold War is expressed in the characterisation of the remorseless Empire via the genocidal explosion of the civilian planet of Alderaan.</p>

<p class="caption">"But we are peaceful! We have no weapons!"</p><p>Later in <em>Return of the Jedi</em>, the Rebel Alliance triumphs against Imperial forces by allying with the friendly indigenous people of Endor, a subplot with unsavoury parallels in United States foreign policy history. By this reading, the text flatters the historical ambitions of the USA and its allies—casting the world's most powerful state as the noble rebel—and naturalises the USA's own empire-building.</p><p>These associations from Empire to Soviet Union, Rebel Alliance to USA, lie between fantasy and ideological fiction, not fiction and reality. An <a href="http://www.weeklystandard.com/article/2540">extended contrary reading of <em>Star Wars</em></a> offers some insight by inverting fictional values and claiming the Empire was actually good. But this is contradictory, as the fictional Empire is clearly very bad—what is really discovered by this interpretation is that the idea of real evil on which the Empire is grounded is absurd. The film-making process has converted artistic, commercial and ideological components into an illusion that incorporates all three. </p><p>Compared to the original <em>Star Wars</em>, <em>The Force Awakens</em> is an encumbered artistic project and a low risk commercial venture. It's a new instalment of the only "cinematic universe" to attempt a chronological narrative over such a long period with a returning cast, and also has to pave the way for at least five more planned Disney <em>Star Wars</em> films. The awfulness of the <em>Star Wars</em> prequel trilogy means that <em>The Force Awakens</em>' subcreative fidelity to the aesthetic and world-building of the original films will be under scrutiny. Due to its global distribution, it has to be palatable to almost any audience, and as its backdrop is a fantasy of world-historical military conflict, it will inevitably trace out some trajectory in the ideological field surrounding actual history. </p><p>If there were a temporal homomorphism between the fictions of history and those of Hollywood, we could extrapolate this sort of experimentation against today's geopolitics and predict the content of <em>The Force Awakens</em>. It would be crude to claim that texts in general follow such a rule, but given the unique constraints in play for this film, is it possible to draft its horoscope? </p><p>The bad guys of <em>Star Wars</em> are already in control of vast weaponry and industry, and motivated by the ceaseless and rational expansion of their dominion. As Vader states to Luke, "[together] we can end this destructive conflict and bring order to the Galaxy." <em>Star Wars</em>' powerful, militarised enemy is consistent with a bipolar model of world affairs in America during the late Cold War. The depiction of the Empire erases intimacy and humanity—we don't see the private lives of the soldiers or stormtroopers of the Empire, or any hint of civilian life under the Empire. </p>

<p class="caption">"All those innocent contractors brought in to do the job were killed"</p><p>By contrast, the grand theme of the present is that of a world brought to a benevolent order by the progressive "international community", but remaining under threat from a phantasmal "clash of civilisations". A warfare of "interventions" continues without cease under this paradigm, but its pretexts vacillate between the material, and the anxiously conjectural: that the enemies will obtain powerful weapons; that motivated by their evil ideas, the enemies will strike within peaceful domestic communities; that the enemies will carry out human rights abuses against their own (or our own) populations. </p><p>To fit this mould, the antagonists of <em>The Force Awakens</em> will be diffuse and sometimes hidden, their motivations irrational and hard to comprehend. They will be under the influence of false, evil ideas—there will be little intelligible basis for their perniciousness other than these bad ideas. Contemporary paranoia will mean one or more characters who should <em>be good</em> turn out to <em>be evil</em>. The antagonists will commit atrocities on a less than genocidal scale, showing their willingness to commit greater atrocities. They will not at first pose an existential threat, but Burke's "inactivity of good men" will allow them (or depending on where the story starts, will have allowed them) to obtain enormous destructive power. </p><p>(A reason the prequel trilogy felt so incoherent reveals itself here. The Phantom Menace appeared during the triumph of Fukuyama's "end of history", following the collapse of the USSR and before 9/11, but dealt with a fictional period chronologically before <em>Star Wars</em>' great bipolar conflict. With the Hollywood imaginary bereft of a recognised antagonist, no wonder The Phantom Menance hinged on inscrutable trade embargoes. It's no joke to hypothesise that the mere reflection of the pompous, pragmatic gravity of military interventions in the Middle East will be weighed as a convincing solemnity in the new films.)</p><p><img _="" alt="The Force Awakens: Kylo Ren" src="/2015/12/15/a-horoscope-for-the-force-awakens/starwars_kylo_ren.jpg" /> </p><p class="caption">The Force Awakens trailer: Kylo Ren</p><p></p><p>The story of <em>The Force Awakens</em> will be one in which the battle lines of a major struggle are drawn after a failure of Republican virtue allows an uprising against the post-Imperial galactic order. Military or weapons technology will play a role in escalating the threat posed into outright war, a military conflict that would backdrop the next two instalments of this trilogy. Or there is a possibility that the story will begin in the middle, once a great conflict has already begun, and instead it will be a lost or secret technology that offers the possibility of ending war. </p><p>There will not be blatant xenophobic caricatures among these predicted enemies. Their appearance will allude aesthetically to Christian, fascist and white supremacist style and iconography, in keeping with the original trilogy, and having learnt the lessons of the prequels' critics. </p><p>Turn to the protagonists. When planning the original trilogy, George Lucas worked with the dubious monomyth of Joseph Campbell's Hero's Journey. Although Campbell's schema has elaborate details, its crux is the organisation of the story around a single hero. Lucas was inspired by the planetary romances of the American pulp magazines of the interwar period and their descendants, whose formulaic approach, oriented to a male reader, was streamlined by the writers' hard deadlines and rates of payment. </p><p>The <a href="https://sfy.ru/?script=star_wars">screenplay of the original <em>Star Wars</em></a> introduces Luke Skywalker as a farmer's son free from artifice: </p>
<div class="screenplay">EXTERIOR: TATOOINE -- DESERT WASTELAND -- DAY.
 <br /><br />
A death-white wasteland stretches from horizon to horizon. The 
tremendous heat of two huge twin suns settle on a lone figure, 
Luke Skywalker, a farm boy with heroic aspirations who looks 
much younger than his eighteen years. His shaggy hair and 
baggy tunic give him the air of a simple but lovable lad with 
a prize-winning smile.</div><p><img _="" alt="Luke at Owen and Beru's farm" src="/2015/12/15/a-horoscope-for-the-force-awakens/starwars_luke_tatooine.png" /> </p><p class="caption">Luke Skywalker at Owen and Beru's farm</p><p></p><p>The image conveys many things. The land itself granted importance by the establishing shot, and the claim to land identified by what is recognisably a settler's farm; a man, comfortable in his surroundings and evidently at home, together with the implements of his work; the poeticised evidence of the struggle of his family in solitude against a hostile landscape. It's a highly recognisable motif, evoking a false nostalgia for virtuous settler-colonialism that is the currency of white American culture. Luke's youth and the cut of his clothes hammer home his innocence and charm. Hopeful musical cues sound to say: your hero.</p><p><img _="" alt="Owen and Beru's bodies" src="/2015/12/15/a-horoscope-for-the-force-awakens/starwars_owen_beru.jpg" /></p><p>The massacre of Luke's parents that soon follows is never again mentioned: their incineration serves to cauterise the wound of Luke's departure from home. As <em>Star Wars</em> unfolds it remains the story of Luke Skywalker, within which his friends, teachers and family are mainly ciphers drawn from Campbell's arcana: Han Solo, a "shapeshifter", Princess Leia, a "goddess", and so on.</p><p>A <a href="http://decider.com/2015/12/11/the-radicalization-of-luke-skywalker-a-jedis-path-to-jihad/">viral article</a> has suggested that Luke's story is one of religious radicalisation under the tuition of Obi-Wan Kenobi, who sets him on the path to become a dangerous fundamentalist. The cleverly alienating analogy of this reading highlights the ideologically driven violence of the Rebel Alliance, but fails to relate what it finds back to the elided violence, welded to global dominion, of the west.</p><p>Now Lucas's cod sword and planet mythology has been superseded by the corporate expertise of JJ Abrams, Hollywood's most polished franchisee. An image from the trailer shows us a ruined Star Destroyer, symbolising the cultural mass of the original trilogy, that has literally crushed the terrain in which a new Hero's Journey of the old sort might germinate. </p><p><img _="" alt="The Force Awakens: a crashed Star Destroyer" src="/2015/12/15/a-horoscope-for-the-force-awakens/starwars_crashed_star_destroyer.jpg" /> </p><p class="caption">The Force Awakens trailer: a crashed star destroyer</p><p></p><p>There will be not be as much room as Luke had in <em>The Force Awakens</em>. The screenplay must make space for each returning cast member, as well as deploying many new characters. Logistically it will resemble Marvel's recent Avengers films, with apportioned screen time, divided action, character intimacy rapidly generated and discarded, and many ensemble and council scenes, as well as at least one obligatory spaceship battle and lightsaber duel. </p><p>The trailer and advance press prominently featuring John Boyega and Daisy Ridley have already given away that there will be more than one protagonist. There will be more than one major plot line to be carried through the three films of the new trilogy. The protean critical affordances of complex regimes of plot and character hold marketing advantages: more to discuss, more traction, more perspectives. This popular <a href="http://mobile.nytimes.com/2015/12/20/movies/in-new-star-wars-daisy-ridley-and-john-boyega-brace-for-galactic-fame.html">New York Times profile</a> on Boyega and Ridley is indicative. Each actor is well prepared for the inevitable question on the significance of their casting: a question that in being perpetually asked, makes being a non-white hero or a "strong female character" perpetually novel. The article's progressive audience is gratified by its negative self-definition relative to the feeble racist critics—"victims of a disease"—of Boyega's casting, creating incentive to buy a ticket. Today's films can both celebrate difference and equality and simultaneously enforce prejudice, while profiting by the discussion either mode generates—but the profit motive is superordinate. </p><p>Another clue to the heroes' formation in <em>The Force Awakens</em> is the first thing we saw in its very first teaser trailer: Boyega as a stormtrooper with his helmet off, sweating with anxiety in the desert. This brilliant image, which may not be surpassed by anything else in the film, signalled intent to reconfigure familiar signs from the original trilogy. An inevitable change will be members of the returning central cast taking on the more peripheral, expendable roles occupied by their mentors and counsellors in the original trilogy. Someone will be sacrificed to initiate the new heroes. </p><p>Our proximity to character psychology will also change. Lando Calrissian's meek capitulation in <em>The Empire Strikes Back</em> is as close as that trilogy comes to an on stage betrayal. A morally troubled protagonist is a popular device in fiction, and a relatively sure sign that a horrible atrocity is about to be committed. In <em>The Force Awakens</em>, although good and evil will remain embodied essences subject to certain tropes—"there is still good in him"—the associated signals will be confused and amplified, and the film's plot will lead us through discovery of these rebooted goodies and baddies in preparation for the sequels. The heroes will oscillate neurotically rather than developing, drama radiating from the omnidirectional kinetic energy of aggregated incident. </p><p>As it premieres, <em>The Force Awakens</em> seems to be the sequel the first three films deserve—a faithfully overblown imitation. The available trailers and media suggest an eye for the aesthetic of <em>Star Wars</em> that transcends the visually illiterate mashup of Buck Rogers, Prince Valiant and Jim Henson that was the prequels and the unfortunate Special Edition. With their erasure of much-hated mistakes, their teases of adored returning characters, and their return to "material effects", the new film-makers have carefully curated their rectitude for fans. </p><p>Though its screenplay will adopt forms from other franchises to accommodate Disney's extensive plans for the <em>Star Wars</em> brand, this will clearly be another story about an embattled Republic that implicitly praises the global role of the USA and its allies. Its antagonists will probably resemble shadowy terrorists, its plot will probably hinge on magical military technology, and its critics' sentimental attachment to its heroes' varied struggles will probably exculpate it for the toxic meanings of its underlying structure. </p><p>And yeah, I have got a ticket of course—so I suppose I'll find out how much I got wrong in a couple of days.</p></body></html></div>
